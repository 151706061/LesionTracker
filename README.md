# LesionTracker
An early prototype viewer application for oncology based on Cornerstone.  It was based on Web Components, but due to the lack of full support for Web Components in all major browsers at the time, we chose to use meteor and its packages to encapsulate our modules.  

THIS REPO IS OBSOLETE.  THE LESION TRACKER CODE WAS MOVED TO: https://github.com/OHIF/Viewers
